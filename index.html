            <h3>About me(your next valued employee)</h3>
            <p>Finding what I want to do late in life, I am a husband and father and serial geek. My first career is still one that I love; radio. I worked in the indusry for close to 20 years. Still love a good talk show. After that I bounced around not knowing what to do and even did some construction work, which, is way out of my comfort elemnet. I surprised myself when I excelled at it too. Was put into the positin of Foreman even. At a suggestion from a friend, and some prodding from family, I decided to put one of my hobbies together with my career. Now, here I am. STarting as a Full-Stack developer with hopes to add other coding knowledge to my bag of tricks. Pleased that you took the time here on my page and hope to talk to you in the near(or far) future.</p>
